# Legged robot
Universal code for any kind of legged robots. Mobile friendly web interface included.

## Purposouse of the project
This my attempt to make building legged robots as simple as possible (inspired by ArduPilot project). 
This code mostly based on [ESP32 robot dog](https://github.com/SovGVD/esp32-robot-dog-code) code, but is not hardcoded to four legged robots. Also licence has been changed.
